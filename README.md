## Domain Description<br>
Our application is centered around the board game "Betrayal at House on the Hill."
In this game, players explore a haunted house, encountering various events, items, and scenarios. 
The goal of our project is to create a comprehensive wiki-style database that organizes all relevant information related to the game.
<br>

### Database Model<br>
- Our database models various aspects of the game:
- Event Cards: Details about event cards that players encounter during gameplay, including unique card IDs and associated missions.
- Room: Descriptions of rooms, including unique room IDs, names, difficulty levels, and types of cards present (omen, item, event). Rooms may appear on multiple floors.
- Floor: Information about different floors, each with a unique floor number, danger level, and room composition.
- Mission: Details of missions with IDs, levels, and associated side quests. Each mission may have suggested characters and rewards.
- Character: Information about characters, including unique combinations of first and last names, HP, alignments, and special attributes.
